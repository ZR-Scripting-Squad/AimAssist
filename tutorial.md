This quick read allows you to install and use AimAssist very quickly.

# How to install

AimAssist is a userscript - a program that runs in the browser. Specifically, it injects Javascript into the Zombsroyale website for it to work.

This means that it requires a userscript manager.

### Step 1: Install Tampermonkey

If you have not installed a userscript manager yet, follow these steps: 

Go to the Chrome Web Store and [install Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

If you are using Firefox, go to the Firefox Add-ons site and [install Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).

This program should work with other userscript managers, but we only guarantee compatibility with these two.

### Step 2: Install the program

Once you have finished installing the userscript manager, click the _install now_ link above. You may need to wait a bit for the userscript manager to process it,  but you will see a page like this:

Simply click "Install" and you're good to go!
